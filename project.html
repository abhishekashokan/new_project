        <h2>PLAY AND LEARN KIDS LEARNING APPLICATION</h2>
        <ul>
          <p1 class="spaced-text">Play and Learn is an innovative and engaging mobile application designed to enhance children's learning experiences through interactive play. This application aims to bridge the gap between education and entertainment, providing
             a fun and captivating platform for children to acquire knowledge and skills across various subjects.<br>
            The Play and Learn application incorporate a wide range of educational games, activities, and 
            interactive modules tailored to different age groups. By leveraging the power of gamification, the application 
            promotes active learning, critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity in children. By combining
             education and entertainment, Play and Learn strives to inspire children's curiosity, foster a love for 
             learning, and promote academic excellence. Through its user-friendly interface, interactive features, and
              comprehensive content, this application offers a powerful tool for children to acquire knowledge, develop skills,
               and unlock their full potential.

        <h2>LIP READING USING MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS</h2>
        <ul>
          <p1 class="spaced-text">Lip reading is a skill that allows people to understand speech by observing the movements of the speaker's lips.
             It is a useful skill for people with hearing loss, as well as for people who need to communicate in noisy environments or with people 
             who speak different languages. This project aims to develop a lip-reading system using machine learning which is designed to be helpful 
             when say there is a situation where we need to extract conversations from recorded footages but audio data is not available or reliable,
              or a noisy environment, where audio/speech detection becomes unreliable and erroneous, also it will help to improve the quality of life 
              of those people with hearing and speech impairments. <br> The system will be trained on a dataset of lip movements labelled with the corresponding
               words and phrases. Once trained, the system will be able to recognize words and phrases from new lip movements. The system will be developed
                using a deep learning model. Deep learning models are a type of machine learning model that are particularly well-suited for tasks such as 
                image recognition and speech recognition. In this context deep learning, image processing is used in lip reading systems because they are
                 particularly well-suited for tasks such as feature extraction and pattern recognition. </p1>
